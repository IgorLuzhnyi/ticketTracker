6. Make max number message of additional links
7. Make "due dates"
9. Add sorting functionality
10. Add error page when there is no such projectId or ticketId in the path
15. Check if can refine the form using useWatch - probably would be more neat for defaultValue inside the fields

25. There is a behavior when project is removed, but we are still on Ticket editing page with all the data
26. When adding new link in editing ticket page, Typography with an error doesn't show up in ticket link field. Basically go over all error messages in links here
28. Work on fields validation when adding links (existing ones are fine, maybe copy their setting). For some reason the form with new links submits, even though the field requirements are not met 
29. Probably remove uuid, need to leave only useForm's ids created by default. Need to adjust link's type, probably set id as to an optional one or whatever
31. Work on ticket statuses
32. Make "please log in or continue as a guest" for the "/" path
34. Adjust the Input and Button to styled
